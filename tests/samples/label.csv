Grayhound was an off-shoot of the short-lived Wicked Records project whose memorable hit was DJ Garth & ETI's 'Twenty Minutes of Disco Glory' from 1996.

The label went on to expand it's roster including a stable of like-minded artists: Rocket (Garth & Eric James), DJ Garth & ETI, Crosstown Traffic (Garth & Rob Doten), Michoacan, Garth & Markie Mark, Jeno, DJ Harvey, Stranger (Ben Cook), Nectar, DJ Rasoul, Doc Martin, Dano & Joeski, Rob Paine, Defenders of the Faith, Mirror Boys (Thomas Bullock), Perry Farrell, Community Recordings, EBE, Audio Soul Project, Nick Chacona, Joshua Collins, Patrick Turner, Charles Spencer, Succulent & Mayaku. 

Over a ten year period Grayhound released 54 vinyl singles. There were three compilation CDs culled from the catalogue and mixed by Garth.

Vinyl was mastered by George Horn at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA with artwork from James Bates at Atom Design in London.

The concept was simple at first: they just wanted to put out their own music their own way. After the first few releases it became clear that they had dropped in on a genre of house music that has slowly but surely come to fruition, now being labeled by the massive as ""dub house"". They knew they were not the first to use the influence of Jamaican reggae music as a foundation for their house productions, but they definitely wanted to continue to push it to new heights in both the house community and progressive reggae scene. 

What started out as an in-house production label, Worship soon started to sign like- minded artists such as: Garth, Chris Udoh, Pete Moss, Solomonic Sound, Hakan Lidbo, Jay Tripwire and Grant Dell- just to name a few. Some Worship releases are more dub than house and vice versa - but all releases are pure quality. From the music’s production quality to the legendary KLH art work and right down to the packaging, Worship Recordings is never slacking. They continue to explore new methods of using reggae and house music side by side to reach lovers of both sounds and to unite them in the dance hall as ONE.",,Needs Vote

e: music@statra.com","Statra Recordings is the well-respected independent record label founded by Brooklyn native Dave Tomaselli back in April of 1999. The label was created to help distinguish electronic music in full-length album form from its short-lived often-unrecognized cousin the 12 club record. Statra is one of those always present but under the radar record labels that focuses on quality over quantity. 

Statra quickly set the benchmark for electronic labels in the US with its unconventional A&R style and the infamous compilation series Harry The Bastard Presents - Club H. A succession of innovative and highly coveted albums from artist like Jeff Sharel, Denver McCarthy, Charles Webster, and the 2000 label compilation Statras Paradigm Shift quickly propelled Statra onto the international stage. The labels releases were often referred to as timeless, future classic, and even brilliant. 

With the creation of the vinyl only sub-labels STATRA TWELVES (Deep & Tech House), STATRAVEL (Leftfield & Down-Tempo), and STATRAX, the collaboration label formed with world-renowned DJ & producer Victor Calderone, Statra continues to find success both on and off the dance floor. 

Statras catalog is distributed in the US by A.D.A., Fusion 3 in Canada, Amato in UK, and is available online at most digital download retailers via IODA. 

Statra artists include: Harry The Bastard, Jeff Sharel, Lypid, Denver McCarthy, Nu Mood Orchestra, Chris J, Charles Webster, Astrid Suryanto, J.Axel, Mr. Velcro Fastener, Victor Calderone, Stacy Burket, Alexi Delano, Nick Chacona, Jussi Pekka, and James Geche.

The FAX releases are strictly limited, depending on the project. Most released are produced in editions of 500, 1000, 2000 or 3000 copies.
Some specific titles were licensed out to other labels ([l=Music Man Records], [l=R & S Records] and [l=Rising High Records] to name the most common licensees) for unlimited distribution in FAX's early days.

Ambient World is a sublabel of FAX, catalog numbers starting with AW. AW only publishes re-releases with unlimited distribution, but with a different cover design (and occasionally different tracks or edits).

Yesterday And Tomorrow releases are used for an ambient/classical fusion and recieve the YT catalog numbers. The PKPWPS catalog numbers are used for compilations.

Label Code: LC 2518 / LC 02518
Often originally associated as a club jazz label, that accounts for only a percentage of the music they have actually released. They are better known more recently for the full spectrum of sounds they release, with some of the finest electronic and non-electronic club music available. From house to disco, triphop to techno, jazz to downbeat; you'll find most sounds appearing somewhere on either the main Compost Records label, or appearing on one or more of the other five sublabels currently run. 

Big names in the electronic scene —for example [a=Moodymann], [a=Carl Craig], [a=Laurent Garnier], [a=Masters At Work], [a=Âme], [a=Dixon], [a=Henrik Schwarz], [a=Kruder & Dorfmeister], et al— have either contributed tracks of their own, remixes, or both. Furthermore, many fairly unknown yet talented smaller producers have also had their break on the label. 

Tracks from both sources can often be found on one of the many compilations the label releases. Series like ""Future Sound Of Jazz"" (currently at volume 11), ""Partykeller"" (2 volumes), or ""Elaste"" (2 volumes), and some others, have helped the label achieve cult status for music collectors around the world. 

So far the label has released more than 350 releases, around 80 artist albums, and done so across six labels.",Compost Medien GmbH & Co. KG,Correct

This label consistently produced innovative material, which at times was ruthlessly anti-commercial. (not entirely on purpose either). The label has worked with many artists using or fusing many styles of music. Apart from the underground groups and collaborations, the label’s other projects are the Waw Ffactor and Pic Nic, that are more commercially appealing. Yet both groups can be listened to on two (or more) levels, which is why an R-Bennig record is always intriguing and becomes even more so when listened to repeatedly. The Waw Ffactor, which is fronted by actress and singer Rachel Carpenter, has achieved success in both Wales and on the European continent.
There was also another off-shoot of this label called Wili Nili that had at least 4 releases, including an album by an Italian mod band called Smodati. However, you never quite trusted Johnny R as it may have been a complete wind up, and the band could have been from Llangefni...!
Another note: R-BEN 052 – Mank LP – Ben Powell (Mank) says, ‘Love the fact that the “Mank LP” was withdrawn, that was actually a demo CD I sent Johnny, I later found out that the songs had been registered on PRS without my knowledge and not in my name.’",,Needs Vote

It was created on 2011 by El Pricto as a platform for interchange between musicians dedicated to the search of new, adventurous and strange forms of expression.

At Discordian we want to create and expand the magic of unconventional music and sound experiments. Our commitment is to music, willing to discover new composers and improvisers. That is why each month we invite different musicians to record composed and improvised music. Our main objective is to help create an Avant-Garde musical scene in Barcelona where musicians can meet each other, share and cooperate; A community… A Discordian Community…

Discordian Records is managed by El Pricto and Ralph Lopinski, and works in conjuction with Arco y Flecha Productions to organize concerts, find gigs and promote bands that appear on the label. Every year they organize in Barcelona a festival called Discordian Community Riot! as a showcase for Discordian artists.

As a record label we offer musicians the opportunity to record, mix and master their music in exchange for appearance and distribution in the label’s web pages. Also with The Discordian Mobile Recording Unit we can record concerts anywhere in high quality audio.

“A discordian is anyone willing to look at windmills and concede that they might be giants”

Warning: At Discordian Records we use Discordianism as a philosophy but not as a religion. We are not an organization or sect, we only use the discordian philosophy to promote artistic activities. Our goal is to exchange ideas freely, without the intervention of any institution.",,Needs Vote

387355,MGM Music Scoring Stage,,"Largest motion picture scoring venue in the world, based in Culver City, CA, USA. Originally the historic [b]MGM Scoring Stage[/b], it is also known as the [b]Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage[/b]. Nowadays it is also referred to as the Sony Music Scoring Stage. It's part of the [l280436] complex.

In the 1970s, the entire lot was acquired by investor Kirk Kerkorian, and in the following years the filming and post-production studios changed hands several times, until Sony Pictures made them their global headquarters in 1990. They modernised and revitalised the 180,000-square-metre lot, and in 1994, the sound recording stage was renamed the Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage, honouring the diva who had recorded some of her most celebrated work on the premises.

Despite everything, though, the 600-square-metre live room, one of the largest recording spaces in the world, remains almost entirely in its original condition. Only a few details of the room itself have been altered through the years, but the technical equipment is up to the most modern of standards. The studio, which is still known as the MGM Stage by many industry professionals, is equipped with a cutting-edge Neve 88R console featuring 96 input channels and 192 inputs with motorised faders during mixdown. 

The building that now houses the scoring stage was built in 1929, originally as a filming stage, although even in its early years it was used for sound recording purposes from time to time. The soundtrack to the colossally successful 1939 film The Wizard Of Oz was recorded here, and subsequently the studio was used solely for sound recording. The list of classic films with soundtracks recorded at the MGM scoring stage includes such milestones as Gone With The Wind (1939), Ben Hur (1959), Lawrence Of Arabia (1962) and Doctor Zhivago (1965).",,Correct
